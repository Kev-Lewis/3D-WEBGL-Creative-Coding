# 3D & WEBGL - (Creative-Coding)
-------------------------------------------
Instructions:

Drag the mouse around the canvas to rotate the center donut & boxes
rotating around it.

Dragging the mouse around also moves the directional light of the blank
rotating cubes.

-------------------------------------------
Description:

First, I started with the center donut using the normalMaterial since I
thought it looked very cool. I had it rotate automatically at first, but then changed
it to rotate with the mouse. 

Next I wanted to add cubes, and as I was adding cubes, I
realized that one of them would perfectly go through the center of the donut, which I
thought was awesome, so I added 5 more of them and put a texture of Fry from Futurama, which is
one of my favorite shows of all time. 

After having the donut and the textured cubes that pass
through the middle, I thought about how I should add the light source type of objects. I
looked through the directional light reference as a start, then I changed it from a sphere to
a cube. 

I wanted this cube to not be affected by the donut or mouse, so I used the push and
pop functions to keep them as their own objects, and then I put 7 more to create a cube
like shape when looking at them while not moving. 

Finally, I added movement so that they would rotate around
the donut while interesecting with eachother which I thought looked pretty
cool.
